                    Software verification has been a fundamental part of the software development
                    life cycle for decades. As todays software becomes increasingly complex, the
                    need for more advanced and efficient verification methods has never been greater.
                    While simple programs can rely on testing, advanced programs require a more
                    elaborate, formal approach, especially in safety-critical environments such as medical devices or cryptography. <br> <br>

                    Octagonal relations are popular abstractions of software systems used in program verification. 
                    While in theory they can be used to decide a range of problems in polynomial 
                    time, in practice their effectiveness is limited because they
                    can get computationally expensive. Scout utilizes advanced algorithms and data structures 
                    introduced by Filip Konecn&#7923; to accelerate the analysis of octagonal relations. <br>
                    The original software was written in java. Using C++ we achieved great performance increases of up to 518x and a framework that
                    is easier to integrate into other tools that are not written in JVM-languages.
                    Scout is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing it to be integrated
                    into various software verification tools. The library also includes certain new
                    optimizations, to speed up acceleration, that were not present in earlier implementations. <br> <br>

                    This is the first major C++ project I developed from scratch and was part of my Bachelor's Thesis. It sparked my interest in C++ development and high performant code.
                    Even during development I went back to rewrite the entire codebase quite a few times because I was learning so much. Now that I have had some distance and learned a lot more
                    I would love to some day have the time to rewrite it once more. Even if I did I'd probably say the same next year. <br> <br>

                    You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/TorbenSteegmann/Scout" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
