                    <h3>The Game</h3>
                    In Hamnu, you take the role of a 'resurrected'. After a thousand years you wake up in the depths of a prison maze deep under a pyramid. 
                    Along with thousands of other
                    poor souls you find yourself being able to control one of the four elements: fire, water, earth or wind. 
                    However, you were awakened with a purpose: 
                    fight for survival in the legendary games of Hamnu. Along with three comrades you have to battle mindless 
                    risen and another team of four resurrected. Collect their souls 
                    to grow strong enough to destroy their life beacon and win the game. 
                    All for the entertainment of the god-king. <br> <br>

                    As this has been in development for a long time the influences have varied. The game concept is something I have 
                    not seen in this form and am therefore excited about.
                    If you still wanted a comparison to existing games I would have to say: A mixture between Super Smash Bros., 
                    League of Legends and Black Desert.


                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    This is my first and longest running major project. Even though I had coded simple games before, I had to relearn to walk. 
                    Literally. Because this game is meant to be played 
                    online most of the techniques used to implement movement and abilities get a lot more complex even when using a game engine. 
                    In fact one of the greater challenges to overcome
                    was what seemed to be small a movement bug due to networking. When I was using peer-to-peer connection the server side 
                    would always dash further than the clients could. 
                    This was because the movement system is velocity based. When a player pressed their dash button the 
                    server would over correct their velocity due to movement prediction 
                    resulting in a dampening that slowed the dash down. <br><br>
                    

                    The project was originally build in a game engine, however I wanted more independence which is why I started rebuilding it
                    from scratch. There are multiple reasons behind this step. The engine I used is tailored to 3D games. Even though it does 
                    support 2D development, a lot of the methods feel more like 'hacks' than actually intended purpose. It feels like driving 
                    a ferrari on a rocky road. Sure you can do it but I'd rather use a simpler car thats made for it. Or in this case: build one.
                    An alternative would have been to swap to another game engine, however they either do not support networking that well or are unity 
                    which I chose to boycott. Another reason for this change is experience. Now that I have a lot better understanding of C++ it feels
                    like a perfect opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.<br>
                    In preparation for this massive undertaking I am currently programming another shorter game: "Naualli". I might make a separate blog post to this one. <br>
                    As you may notice I can unfortunately not provide any screenshots. This is a passion project that I did not plan to share
                    for a long time which is why I used copyrighted art of my favorite childhood games. 
                    You may expect this to change in the next months when I find time to replace those assets with
                    royalty free placeholders.
