                    I have decided it is finally time to launch this little website as a means of providing a brief overview of me and my 
                    projects, both in and outside of academia. It is not meant to replace a CV, but rather to serve as a personal blog. 
                    This way, I can share not only my finished or major projects but also any 'sidequests' I might be excited about, 
                    even if they are not fully developed.
