                    The first step in creating tools for 3D character development was to analyze the state of the art.
                    Because I was surrounded by amazing 3D artists for some time now, I was already familiar with 
                    many of the tools that are currently in use. To gain a deeper understanding I decided to interview 
                    one of those artists. She showed how most of the relevant software, like Maya, Houdini,
                    Marvelous Designer, etc., worked on a surface level. After this, I opened Blender and got to work on everybody's
                    favorite donut tutorial. After experimenting with the settings a few more days I was finally ready to begin working
                    on my very first <a href="../projects/renderdude.html">Ray Tracer</a>.
